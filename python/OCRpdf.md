### How to turn scanned pdf into text
#### Method 1(Failed)
Please refer to https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF

In `Ubuntu`, 

  - sudo apt install ocrmypdf

**But it did not support Chinese!!!**

	OCR engine does not have language data for the following requested languages: 
	zho
	Note: most languages are identified by a 3-digit ISO 639-2 Code

[3-digit ISO 639-2 Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes)

#### Method 2

  - Transform scanned pdf into images, and then use ocr to recognize the images.
  	+ This step could be done by `adobe acrobat`
  	+ When saving `pdf` into `jpg`, an error occurred: `因为以下错误，Acrobat无法保存本文档中的页面: 图像太宽，无法输出。请裁切图像或降低分辨率，然后重试。(页面1)`
  		* At first I think the reason is that the `pdf` file I am about to convert has many pages, and `acrobat` save the pdf into a single large image file, so I choose to split it.

			- And the error still occurs.
		* The solution is in [acrobat pdf 导出图片时遇到“图像太宽，无法输出”的错误](https://blog.csdn.net/n_o_error/article/details/130359271). Just changing the resolution of the saved image will work.
		* The file size generated by acrobat is too large and the generation is slow.
			- When the resolution is 236.22 pixel/cm, the resulting file is 3-4 M.
			- Even if the resolution is 28.35 pixel /cm, the resulting file still exceeds the resolution limit of the OCR in the next step. So **finally I decided to use wechat to do ocr**.
