# Development of TCA-SA platform

  - Acquisition using Lecroy Oscilloscope
  	+ I want to do it in three phases: the first phase include collecting information, which has been done by now. In the second phase, I will write some demo to connect with Lecroy Scope to get some information. In the third phase, the development in TCA-SA starts officially.
